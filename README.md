# Advent of Code 2019

This project contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2019 event.

I wanted to only use programming languages that I'm unfamiliar with and I also switched to a new language every two days.

Therefore the code quality is probably pretty bad but my main goal was to learn something new.
